# shipstationAPI
This is a program that I developed using Shipstation's current API, the goal was to clean the order data into the proper format used in spreadsheets at AJ Bednar Enterprises Inc. Using the doccumentation from https://www.shipstation.com/docs/api/ to connect with our current order and store data the information from https://medium.com/@jb.ranchana/write-and-append-dataframes-to-google-sheets-in-python-f62479460cf0 to connect to google drive and google sheets. I was able to read in order data sorted by newest to oldest so that it could be cleaned into its proper format and exported directly into our order data google sheet.
